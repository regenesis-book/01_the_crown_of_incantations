THE CROWN OF INCANTATIONS
**************************

Author: `Vinay Keerthi <mailto:ktvkvinaykeerthi@gmail.com>`_

-----------------------

Ten years after a revolution that divided his kingdom in two, a revolution
*he* led, Krono-Kroman, the Sorcerer-King, receives word that his kingdom is
at risk once again. To secure its freedom, he must retrieve that which he
thought he had once destroyed: an object of such incomprehensible power that
it cannot be destroyed. The Crown of Incantations.

However, to do so, he must travel across worlds, journeying across reality
itself: to the world of the Creator.
