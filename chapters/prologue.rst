    Need to figure out how to specify locations and timelines. I can use location codes and maintain a database of these. But the way I define characters, locations and significant times should be definable within the structure of the book, so that the code can be run without any prerequisites. For the most part, I need to build some kind of parser and, in the future, a highlighter for this structure. For Vim at least?


======================================
Prologue : The Arrival of the Khaay
======================================

A ragged horse cart trotted along a stone-paved road that had recently been repeated.

It was a bright dawn. Not yet completely day of course, because if it had been, farmer Meelo would have had to turn back – it was useless to get to the city after everyone else had finished setting up their stalls.

Meelo looked over his back suspiciously at the road; he had come across no trouble along these roads before. The idea was almost ludicrous, this country was the safest in the world. The sounds of his rickety cart and the wagon behind it holding his stores of corn and barley would fetch a good price. The green pastures of the valley had rewarded everyone well this year. Harvests had been plenty in the last ten years, since the Sorcerer-King’s coronation. All was well.

Looking ahead he spotted three short figures on the road ahead and raised an eye in surprise. Children out on their own? Straasfore was safe but people needed more caution in their lives.

“Hello there!” Meelo called out, waving his hand while pulling Corri to a halt. The dun coloured mare tossed her head and snorted. The three short figures stopped and turned and Meelo vaguely felt that he had made a mistake. 

They were wearing strange clothes, open vests over thin sleeveless shirts and long flowing skirts, all of a monotonous auburn colour. Two of them held bright silver staffs that were as tall as them. The third carried a staff-shaped object wrapped completely in a brown cloth on his shoulder. Strange attire, but the strangest was the fact that grew more apparent as he got closer - they were not children.

The tallest of them was the one carrying the wrapped staff and he could not have been more than five feet. Neatly trimmed beards darkened their chins and their hair was bright red.

“On your way to the city?” he asked.

One of them, the second tallest, stepped forwards and replied, “To Emansun.”

Offering them a slight shrug, Meelo asked, “So where are you from? I’ll bet my horse that I haven’t seen you around last harvest.”

The short man shook his head, “No, you haven’t. We’re travellers, from the Midlands.”

Meelo whistled, “Travellers? I’ve met merchants from as far as Drome and Alahairetaandanell, but I haven’t seen anyone in –” he checked himself and shook his head. “Well, it doesn’t matter. Get on the cart, I’ll give you a ride to the city.”

The man shook his head, staring apprehensively at the taller one. “We don’t want to slow you down sir.”

Meelo shook his head and gestured with his hand for them to get on. “If the Sorcerer-King got the wind that Meelo had let guests to his kingdom go without the barest display of hospitality, he’d not forgive him!” The Sorcerer-King didn't know Meelo personally, but he was hospitable to everyone.

The three men looked at Meelo and the one who’d done all the talking offered a half-smile.

“Very well sir, we accept.”

After a few minutes, Meelo returned Corri to her trot, with the three Midlanders settled on the cart behind him.

“Is it your first time coming to Straasfore?” Meelo said, turning around to look at them.

The man who’d done all the talking was sitting closest to him, his other companions looked on silently as he replied, “Yes, we just arrived a few hours ago and began heading straight to the city.” He pointed at the way-signs along the side of the road. “Those make it easy to travel.”

Meelo nodded. “All his work you know. This kingdom has never been more prosperous than since the Sorcerer-King took over it.”

The Midlander looked interested as he asked, “Since he took over it?”

“Beat the Overlord and his people didn’t he? He ran the Terian scum out of our lands and back to their own. Straasfore was free after four hundred years,” Meelo turned around mid-sentence and looked at the blank expression on their faces. “You don’t mean you haven’t heard the story!”

The Midlander shook his head, trying to appear apologetic. Meelo took in a deep breath to show them how important that was. He hadn’t heard of anyone who didn’t know what this kingdom had gone through.

“I had it from my father who had it from his grandfather, you see, the old kingdom of Straasfore was a beautiful place,” Meelo paused, searching for words, “It was spectacular, the work of the Warlords, who had such strange powers. Now the neighbouring kingdom of Teria was jealous of that kingdom and wanted the power of the Warlords so they attacked when they knew the Warlords couldn’t fight back.”

The Midlander raised an eyebrow but didn’t say anything. “They conquered this country and killed all the Warlords that they could find.”

Meelo waited for a reply and went on when he got none. 

“For three hundred years they ruled without contest, and married the women from the Warlord families. Their children were born with a little of the Warlords’ powers and they called themselves Warlocks, just to make themselves sound different from the Warlords.”

The Midlander raised an eyebrow — he did that a lot — but said nothing.

“Now some of the Warlords who had gone into hiding began to return. Or their children returned, but their power had greatly reduced. They called themselves Wizards instead, though I don’t know the difference much.”

The Midlander nodded, as though he understood something Meelo didn’t.

Meelo ignored him and went on. “The Wizards fought against the Warlocks as hard as they could and they were not winning. Not until he came.”

“The Sorcerer-King?” one of the younger Midlanders asked.

“Well yes and no… his name was Memlus Arelus, he was the first Sorcerer. He gathered the remaining Wizards and attacked the city of Emansun, reaching the court of the Overlord himself.”

Meelo looked skywards and then sighed, “But he died in the attempt.”

The Midlander leaned forwards. “How?”

“No one knows. The Overlord said he killed him but no one believed that story. Some say the Sorcerer stopped himself, learning about the future.”

“The future?”

Meelo smiled. This was the best part of the story. “Yes, it was foreseen that the one who’d liberate Straasfore from the grips of evil would come from the house of the Overlord itself! His own son Krono-Kroman in fact.”

“Why did the Overlord’s son try to liberate Straasfore? Wasn’t he going to be the next Overlord?”

“The Overlord had two sons and he held a contest to see which of them would inherit the throne. But before the contest could end fairly, his other son, Yagnik, murdered him with the help of his ministers and threw Krono-Kroman into a dungeon.”

“Why didn’t he kill him as well?”

Meelo frowned. The Midlander was asking difficult questions now. “I’m a simple farmer, stranger. I do not understand the whims of kings.” When the Midlander didn’t reply, Meelo went on, “Krono-Kroman escaped from the dungeon and fled to the forests where he found Memlus Arelus’s students, or they had found him. In the months that followed Kroman trained his fellow men and built an army and plotted revenge. Soon Krono-Kroman was back with his army to fight the new Overlord, Yagnik. With him at their helm, the Wizards waged war against Emansun and all of Teria. In that battle, it happened - Krono-Kroman became a Sorcerer.”

The Midlander nodded slowly, taking his time about it now. “What happened to the Overlord? Did the Sorcerer-King kill him?”

Meelo frowned. “No, he spared him and any of the ministers who wanted to leave. Led them to the border of Straasfore and allowed them to go to Teria.”

The Midlander said nothing but looked pensively at his companions as though he was talking to them through his mind. 

Meelo began talking about the city of Emansun, he told them how old it was and what a magnificent sight its golden walls were. He told them about the second palace at Emannun, the city the Sorcerer-King had built in memory of the town that had assisted him in the battle, and about the forest of Ten-Alar which was rumoured to house the half-immortal Elwash.

Meelo soon ran out of things to say although he felt he needed to say some more, to tell them about the Sorcerer-King’s powers. But before he had a chance to speak, a sight that could mute even a bard’s voice began rising out of the horizon- the glorious citadel of the city of Emansun.

The citadel dazzled like the sun and appeared like a giant crown placed in the middle of the land. 

Perfect, almost fluid, golden walls rose from the ground and stood blazing in the morning sun. There were no crevices, gaps, or scratches on those towering structures, no damage to show that they had witnessed and withstood years and years of war. The citadel stood in proud glory and at pivotal locations, angular bastions projected from the walls. Meelo had seen them guarded by wizards all the time whenever even the slightest hint of danger crept up. There had been some minor scuffles in the past, but Teria had never managed to gather an army large enough to try and take Straasfore again.

The Midlanders were impressed by the sight, Meelo observed. Of course they were, no other city had golden walls.

He looked ahead as he led Cori to a slightly faster trot, staring up at the main portcullis. From a flag post above the wall hung a bright red banner on it was a picture of a golden eagle with an emerald serpent in its talons; the banner of the Sorcerer-King. The flag of Krono-Kroman – It promised security and the flashing red, gold and green exuded overwhelming power.

Meelo breathed in deeply with awe and pride – these Midlanders were in for the sight of a lifetime.
